# Navigation-Bar-Project
A "navbar" (short for navigation bar) is a graphical control element found on websites and applications that provides a way for users to navigate through the site's or app's different sections. It typically appears as a horizontal or vertical menu and contains links to various pages or sections of the site or app.

Key Components of a Navbar

    1.) Branding: This is often a logo or the name of the website or application, usually positioned at the top or left side of the navbar.
    
    2.) Links: These are the actual navigational elements, which can be text or icons that link to different pages or sections.
    
    3.) Dropdown Menus: These allow for a more complex structure where a main link can reveal additional links in a submenu.
    
    4.) Search Bar: Some navbars include a search input for users to quickly find content on the site.
    
    5.) Buttons/Icons: These can include call-to-action buttons like "Sign Up" or "Log In," and icons for user profiles, shopping carts, etc.
    
Types of Navbars

    a.) Horizontal Navbar: Typically placed at the top of the page, spans horizontally across the screen.
    
    b.) Vertical Navbar: Placed on the side of the page, spans vertically.
    
    c.)Sticky Navbar: Remains fixed at the top or side of the screen as the user scrolls down.
    
    d.) Collapsible/Responsive Navbar: Changes its layout based on the screen size, often transforming into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
